### Description

The Nightmare maid would likely be a dark and mysterious figure, with a presence that is both alluring and unsettling. She would move through the shadows with a graceful, almost ghostly quality, appearing suddenly and disappearing just as quickly. Her eyes would be deep and penetrating, seeming to look right through you and into your darkest fears and secrets.

As a maid, she might serve a powerful master, carrying out their dark bidding and manipulating those around her to achieve their goals. She might also act as a kind of gatekeeper or guardian of the night, ensuring that those who enter the realm of dreams are aware of the dangers that lie within.

Overall, a Nightmare maid would be a figure of mystery and intrigue, with a deep connection to the darkness and the hidden corners of the mind.

But all this is just a concept.

At the moment you are a courier who works at night. Your mission is to deliver packages from the lightest corner to the darkest part of the map. I had problems with texturing, so for now you can only see the walls. Let's imagine that you have vision problems!

May you have the worst working day as a courier.

~~For that game I used only Tic-80. And have too much problems with that. But next time I'l try to use something simpler.~~
